# Newton's Timer

![Workflow result](https://github.com/MaciejCiemiega/NewtonsTimer/workflows/Check/badge.svg)


## :scroll: Description
Simple timer app inspired by Newton's Cradle. Originally created in Jetpack Compose for [#AndroidDevChallenge](https://developer.android.com/dev-challenge).  
Later migrated to **Compose Multiplatform** with support for Android, iOS and Desktop.


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
The goal was to create something simple yet playful to demonstrate (and evaluate) capabilities of Jetpack Compose.  
The result is a (up to) 1 minute timer trying to recreate Newton's Cradle.

Some highlights and links to code:
- Drawing first ball trajectory and hint animation to setup the timer:
  - Usage of `drawArc` with `dashPathEffect` and animated `clipPath` - [code](/composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/mobnetic/newtonstimer/configuration/ConfigurationHint.kt)
- Playful way of setting up timer by dragging first ball. Timer starts as soon as you lift your finger up:
  - Usage of `pointerInput` and `detectDragGestures` - [code](/composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/mobnetic/newtonstimer/configuration/ConfigurationDrag.kt)
- Smooth transitioning between states:
  - Configuration mode and started mode - [code](/composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/mobnetic/newtonstimer/timer/NewtonsTimerScreen.kt)
- Swinging animation is controlling animation from ViewModel and can be paused/resumed:
  - `TargetBasedAnimation` + update loop in a Coroutine - [code](/composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/mobnetic/newtonstimer/timer/NewtonsTimerViewModel.kt)
- Trying to recreate gravitational swing with hit rebound and colliding balls:
  - Custom `Easing` and many parameters - [code](/composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/mobnetic/newtonstimer/balls/SwingAnimation.kt)
- Shadows are blurred and scaled down if ball is swinging higher from the ground:
  - `Brush.radialGradient` and transformations using `graphicsLayer` - [code](/composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/mobnetic/newtonstimer/balls/Shadow.kt)
- Playing hit sounds when balls collide, synchronized with animation.
- Swinging amplitude and hit sound volume decrease with time, reaching 0 at the end of the timer.
- Timer's display is styled with two font sizes and colors. Also font size adjusts to the available space:
  - Using `AnnotatedString.Builder` - [code](/composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/com/mobnetic/newtonstimer/timer/Display.kt)
- Animated change between dark and light mode.
- Support for both portrait and landscape orientations.
